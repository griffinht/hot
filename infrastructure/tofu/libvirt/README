    TEST LOCALLY
    but keep in mind you should never even have to test locally in the first place
    these should be appliances? or idk should they? not really sure tbh
    because keep in mind you can have dev and prod on the same hypervisor so....




    actually maybe experiment with dev and prod domains? and keep disks constant yeah!
