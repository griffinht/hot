This is an instance of <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/">cgit</a> which I <a href="https://griffinht.com/git/hot.git/tree/http/proxied/git">host</a> myself. It serves as a read-only collection of <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repositories either created or used by <a href="https://griffinht.com/about">me</a>. They were previously hosted at <a href="https://github.com/griffinht/">https://github.com/griffinht/</a> until I <a href="/todo">moved them here</a>.

Many of the repositories hosted here are broken and unfinished. 

There is also no mechanism for feedback or collaboration. Consider emailing me at <a href="mailto:Contribute@griffinht.com">contribute@griffinht.com</a> with any questions, feedback, or changes you have regarding the repositories hosted here.
