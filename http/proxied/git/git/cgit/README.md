This read-only collection of git repositories hosted by an instance of <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a>, which I have deployed myself. The git repositories either were created by me or . They used to be found at <a href="https://github.com/griffinht/">https://github.com/griffinht/</a> until I moved them here (todo link blog post abt migration when I fix my blog and write it).

Many of my projects here do not work because they are unfinished or were never even started. 

This does not include any kind of issue tracker or pull request mechanism. I am still open to contributions, so probably just email me at <a href="mailto:contributee@griffinht.com">contribute@griffinht.com</a> with any questions, feedback, or changes you have for the repositories hosted here.
