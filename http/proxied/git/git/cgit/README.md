This read-only collection of git repositories is hosted on my instance of <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/">cgit</a> (<a href="/todo">blog</a>). The git repositories hosted here are either created or used by me. They used to be hosted at <a href="https://github.com/griffinht/">https://github.com/griffinht/</a> until I moved them here (<a href="/todo">blog</a>).

Many of the projects hosted here are broken and unfinished. 

This also does not include any kind of feedback or collaboration mechanism. I am still open to contributions, so probably just email me at <a href="mailto:Contribute@griffinht.com">contribute@griffinht.com</a> with any questions, feedback, or changes you have regarding the repositories hosted here.
